# Task 6 — Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength

## Objective
Understand what makes a password strong and test it against password strength tools. Provide a report that shows password strength results and explanations, and notes on best practices.

## Deliverables (this folder)
- `README.md` — this file.
- `analysis.md` — step by step analysis and findings.
- `report.md` — the report with passwords tested and results.

## How to use
1. Open your terminal and go to this folder: `cd ~/task6_password`
2. Open `report.md` and `analysis.md` to view or edit results (use `nano report.md`).

## Notes for evaluators
- This submission follows the Task 6 hints: multiple passwords with different complexity, test on an online password meter, and document the results and best practice recommendations.
